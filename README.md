# CS313-Project2
In this project I learned how to create a Tree LinkList with unlimited children (not binary), and was able to build function that would find the height, and print the level order of the Tree. Also used ArrayDeque to solve a simple problem that checks if a Parathesis has a closing one or not.
## What I Learned:
	- [x] Learned Deque and ArrayDeque
	- [x] Heap and Stacks
	- [x] Tree Link List
	- [x] Find the height of a none binery Tree Link List
	- [ ] Print the level order data of each node
